1
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,082
It has nothing to do with your Gods.

2
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,999
You face is ugly and your breath stinks.

3
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:22,665
"When time and moment gather,
two sides will be as one.

4
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,915
"When two shadows come together,

5
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:31,915
"life will unfurl and death will be done."

6
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,249
The sea is choppy tonight, Admiral.

7
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:02,290
We are approaching the straits.
It will be calmer then.

8
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,915
Welcome home, Merong.

9
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,374
"Even the vicious tiger
does not eat its cubs"

10
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:17,874
Merong? Your name is not unknown to us.

11
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:21,124
We believe we have heard of you.

12
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:23,874
Ah, no.

13
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:27,290
Or maybe it was your kin.

14
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:31,499
I know of a Merong who caused
some trouble in one of our ports.

15
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:36,624
I heard he went
after a Chinese noblewoman.

16
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:39,332
That is someone else.

17
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,749
I never went to China.
Too far from my home.

18
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:46,124
Must be my uncle, Merong Mahasuasa.

19
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,290
Look at him, don't play with him.

20
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:48,332
You don't belong here, you white ghost.

21
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,707
That boy brings bad luck.

22
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:54,374
Hey kid! Go away!

23
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:56,040
This is all your fault.

24
00:36:56,208 --> 00:37:01,332
Why are you crying, Merong?
Boys don't cry easily.

25
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,915
I don't like girls. I hate them.

26
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:05,915
Am I not a girl?

27
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:08,374
Listen to me.

28
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:15,749
When time and moment gather,
two sides will be as one.

29
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:21,707
When two shadows come together,

30
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:32,499
life will unfurl and death will be done.

31
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:05,540
When time and moment gather,
two sides will be as one.

32
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:11,707
When two shadows come together,
life will unfurl and death will be done.

33
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:15,332
Come here.

34
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,415
Stay here and be quiet.

35
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:21,707
Hide here until I come back.

36
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:30,249
He is the one.

37
00:47:30,416 --> 00:47:33,165
How sure are you?

38
00:47:33,541 --> 00:47:35,874
My feelings say so.

39
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:39,707
He's the one we've been waiting for.

40
00:47:40,708 --> 00:47:42,207
Where am I?

41
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:45,790
Do not try to move
lest the wound opens again.

42
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:51,457
Who... Who are you?

43
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:56,749
I am Kesum. Shaman of the tribe.

44
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:59,957
This is my adopted daughter, Embok.

45
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:09,832
Why?

46
00:48:10,041 --> 00:48:12,415
Rest for a while.

47
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:18,124
I will take care of you until
you are strong enough.

48
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:20,415
Don't worry.

49
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:25,082
The ring will only be opened
when the moon is completely gone.

50
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:27,749
The ring?

51
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:51,707
What do they call you?

52
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:56,707
My name is not fit to be uttered
from the lips of dogs!

53
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:58,124
How rude!

54
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:05,040
Did they not teach you manners
and how to respect a man?

55
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:08,165
You animal! Get off the Princess!

56
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:15,082
Kamawas, restrain yourself!

57
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:25,707
Taji, what is the use
of capturing this fine prize

58
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:28,749
if only to ornament our huts?

59
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:32,457
Patience, my student.

60
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:35,582
This is the princess of a great king,

61
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:37,332
the emperor of China.

62
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,749
A great and strong empire.

63
00:49:40,041 --> 00:49:42,999
And what would insult
the Chinese emperor more

64
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:48,374
than his daughter
becoming my plaything and my pet?

65
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:51,665
I have sent a messenger to China.

66
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:57,332
The princess will not be harmed.

67
00:49:57,958 --> 00:50:03,624
And if the Chinese emperor wishes
for her to continue to be unharmed,

68
00:50:04,208 --> 00:50:08,040
Geruda will be given
a thousand taels of gold

69
00:50:08,416 --> 00:50:10,665
within two full moons.

70
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:17,749
- A thousand taels of gold?
- Yes!

71
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:24,040
And if you can find another port

72
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:27,874
to satisfy your lust for a moon or two,

73
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:33,874
I am also asking the Chinese emperor
to bow down to Geruda

74
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:39,832
so we can be kings of these waters!

75
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:50,374
Many thanks for taking care of me
until I am well.

76
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:53,790
Are you rushing off somewhere?

77
00:50:54,666 --> 00:50:57,832
Your wounds still bleed, young man.

78
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:03,207
Have to get the Jentayu... my vessel.

79
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:07,707
A Jentayu with broken wings will not fly away.

80
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:10,582
Rest here for a while.

81
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:14,415
The Prince under my care is gone.

82
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:21,999
Maybe lost at sea,
or eaten raw by the Gerudans.

83
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,207
What use am I
if I can't fulfil a simple task?

84
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:47,082
Not only am I a vagabond
chased from port to port,

85
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:50,582
I also lost my ship.

86
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:57,249
And with the prince under my watch!

87
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:02,499
I am useless!

88
00:52:03,541 --> 00:52:06,540
Why am I still alive?

89
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:13,832
If you'd like,
you can make our village your home.

90
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:17,749
We come from the earth,

91
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:20,540
live by water,

92
00:52:21,083 --> 00:52:24,499
but some of our tools...

93
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:27,749
we craft from the sky.

94
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:30,082
This keris...

95
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:34,290
I crafted from star metal.

96
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:37,082
Keris for a king.

97
00:52:57,791 --> 00:53:00,040
She does not trust outsiders.

98
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:02,832
Her parents were killed by Gerudans.

99
00:53:09,083 --> 00:53:11,165
Why did you save me?

100
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:41,540
Why are you so brash?

101
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:45,082
When will you leave?

102
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:48,207
When the moon is full?

103
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:51,415
Pak Kesum believes in you.

104
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:56,624
He says you are a foreign King.

105
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:59,707
The saviour of the tribe.

106
00:54:01,666 --> 00:54:06,749
I think you have mistaken me
for someone else.

107
00:54:06,958 --> 00:54:09,290
Our tribe, we are not as one.

108
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:11,999
We fight each other, and are not united.

109
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:16,540
The chief of each village
wants to be king.

110
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:21,082
Pak Kesum stayed where the water falls
for seven days and seven nights

111
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:24,874
until he dreamt of a prophecy,
but you are not the one.

112
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:28,499
You are the same
as the rest of the outsiders!

113
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:34,124
When your wound is healed
you will disappear!

114
00:54:36,041 --> 00:54:37,415
Coward.

115
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:39,124
Coward?

116
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:43,332
What prophecy are you talking about?

117
00:54:44,416 --> 00:54:46,499
I don't know any of this.

118
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:50,832
Yes, I admit.

119
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:55,249
When my wound is healed

120
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:58,665
I will be gone.

121
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,332
The matters of the people
are not my concern.

122
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,957
Just get me to a ship.

123
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:07,874
You want to leave?

124
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:13,957
Why don't you leave now?

125
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:16,499
Go. Go!

126
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:18,374
Leave now!

127
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:57,624
Pak Kesum?

128
00:56:57,791 --> 00:56:59,207
Yes?

129
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:04,790
Why is there a scar on Embok's neck?

130
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,040
A scar?

131
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:12,624
We are a scarred people.

132
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:16,249
But if it is merely a scar on the body,

133
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,499
then many other tribes
have that as well.

134
00:57:20,041 --> 00:57:22,040
But the scar on her heart...

135
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:28,790
That scar is shared by many in the tribe.

136
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:31,374
What do you mean?

137
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:36,249
Let it be known to you
that the Gerudans came from here.

138
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:38,332
They used to be part of us.

139
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:41,374
And Taji, the leader of the Gerudans,

140
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:45,082
studied under the same master as I.

141
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:56,999
Let it be known to you that Taji
was also a drifter like yourself.

142
00:57:57,166 --> 00:58:02,374
He was cared for in this very hut.
My master's hut.

143
00:58:02,541 --> 00:58:04,582
Taji's master as well.

144
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:09,624
He is invulnerable,
because of the amulet around his neck.

145
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:17,915
Taji begged for the amulet,

146
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:21,040
so he could become the tribe's shaman.

147
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,249
But my master declined,

148
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:26,040
because it is his nature

149
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:29,415
not to give to one who asks for it.

150
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:35,374
So he stole it and killed my master.

151
00:58:35,541 --> 00:58:41,082
He gathered followers,
many of them the sons of this tribe.

152
00:58:41,416 --> 00:58:47,040
One night, with those loyal to him,
Taji started raiding the villages.

153
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:49,749
We were surprised, and disorganised.

154
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:53,290
There were those who fought back.

155
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:57,082
One of them was Lang,
the Daughter of the previous two chiefs.

156
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:01,957
She was the first
to get the people to fight back.

157
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:07,624
The first attack was foiled
by her spirit alone.

158
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:15,290
But Taji's amulet was too powerful.

159
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:22,499
Lang?

160
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:25,749
That is my mother's name.

161
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:33,207
Then maybe our meeting
was destined after all, young man.

162
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:41,082
Since then,
the Gerudan pirates would come

163
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:47,582
every few moons
to take anything their hearts desired.

164
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:04,874
And once they came,

165
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:10,249
Kamawas, Taji's student, saw Embok,

166
01:00:10,416 --> 01:00:13,332
the daughter of the chief.

167
01:00:19,791 --> 01:00:23,082
Her father and I tried to stop him.

168
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,832
But Kamawas was also invulnerable
to dagger and spear.

169
01:00:30,708 --> 01:00:34,665
That is why, we are all scarred.

170
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,290
Disunited.

171
01:00:39,666 --> 01:00:42,332
So how do we destroy Geruda?

172
01:00:45,666 --> 01:00:48,457
What did you see in the prophecy?

173
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,082
Prophecy?

174
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,040
Embok told you?

175
01:00:57,833 --> 01:01:03,415
Yes, seven days and seven nights
under falling water.

176
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:08,332
What vision appeared to you?

177
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,499
I had a dream on the seventh night

178
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:15,707
that a foreign king would come

179
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:19,290
in the heat of battle.

180
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:23,832
He will be the one to unite the tribe.

181
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:28,332
I believe...

182
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:34,540
You are the one whose coming was foretold.

183
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:39,790
I think the prophecy is mistaken.

184
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:44,582
Or... I am the wrong man.

185
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:51,457
I am not a foreigner.

186
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:54,999
I remember...

187
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:00,040
I used to lived here.

188
01:02:02,791 --> 01:02:08,832
When time and moment gather,
two sides will be as one

189
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:12,249
What did you say?

190
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:16,249
The pantoum.

191
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,707
It's mother's pantoum.

192
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:22,290
Where did you hear it?

193
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:25,582
The prophecy came with the pantoum.

194
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:28,165
This is the pantoum.

195
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:33,749
Two warring villages
will be as one and fight Geruda.

196
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:39,249
If you still wish to go...

197
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,332
we will not hold you back.

198
01:02:43,833 --> 01:02:50,207
Great teacher Kesum, guide me.

199
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:56,499
What am I to do?

200
01:05:38,791 --> 01:05:41,207
Prepare the roof properly.

201
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:46,332
This will be our shelter
if the Gerudans come again.

202
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:52,957
- How's our progress?
- It will be ready in a couple of days.

203
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:56,457
In the meantime,
this will be our resting place.

204
01:05:57,333 --> 01:06:02,832
Pak Kesum,
there are outsiders on our shore.

205
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:22,082
Kamawas, we are to be attacked!

206
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:29,749
How can that be?

207
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,957
By whom?

208
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:39,040
The mainlanders.

209
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:43,290
The two villages unite under a new king.

210
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,999
Kesum's damned prophecy has come true.

211
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:54,665
The villagers?
How can the few defeat the many?

212
01:11:56,666 --> 01:12:00,540
They are only a few hundred,
most of them farmers.

213
01:12:00,708 --> 01:12:03,499
We number in the thousands ofwarriors.

214
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:13,290
My séance shows

215
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:16,999
that ifwe overcome this obstacle,

216
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,040
these waters will be ours.

217
01:12:19,416 --> 01:12:20,957
What are you talking about?

218
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:24,207
Fall, and we shall never rise again.

219
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:27,040
Are you trying to scare me?

220
01:12:27,416 --> 01:12:29,499
They are not to land on our shores.

221
01:12:29,791 --> 01:12:32,040
I will not sail in the dead of night.

222
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:34,457
And leave you alone with the Princess.

223
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:47,290
That's your plan, isn't it?

224
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:53,790
Kamawas! Don't forget!

225
01:12:55,833 --> 01:13:01,332
Your invulnerability is all due to my amulet!

226
01:13:01,875 --> 01:13:06,624
Lose it, and you will bleed like the rest!

227
01:13:08,208 --> 01:13:09,374
Don't you ever forget it!

228
01:13:16,833 --> 01:13:20,874
Wake me up if they reach our shores.

229
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:25,124
You're going senile.

230
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:31,207
Go attack them, Kamawas!

231
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,707
Where do you think you're going?

232
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:15,624
As long as Taji draws breath,

233
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:18,874
how can I show my face here?

234
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,707
Pak Kesum, you stay here.

235
01:14:29,166 --> 01:14:30,874
Take care of Embok.

236
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:33,832
Take care of the rest.

237
01:14:36,083 --> 01:14:39,415
You have done enough.

238
01:14:47,458 --> 01:14:48,957
Embok.

239
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,582
We might not come back.

240
01:14:58,666 --> 01:15:02,249
If that happens, please take care.

241
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,790
We should not stand here for long.

242
01:15:06,083 --> 01:15:07,290
Go.

243
01:15:08,833 --> 01:15:11,207
Go forth and avenge your mother.

244
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,165
And avenge yourself as well.

245
01:15:15,708 --> 01:15:19,040
- Let us say our good...
- Don't!

246
01:15:32,833 --> 01:15:37,374
This keris you carry,
it will weaken Taji's magic.

247
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:40,707
But it will not take away his invulnerability.

248
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:46,124
His and Kamawas' invulnerability
lies in the amulet.

249
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:51,874
Take away their amulets
and you can take their lives.

250
01:15:53,541 --> 01:15:55,832
I will not forget your advice.

251
01:16:03,541 --> 01:16:06,249
Thank you for everything, Pak Kesum.

252
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,832
Be wary of Geruda's arrows!

253
01:16:39,291 --> 01:16:43,457
If you get wounded,
we have the salve to heal it here.

254
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,624
Goodbye, Embok!

255
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:50,124
Take care of yourself!

256
01:16:50,291 --> 01:16:52,499
No! Our King will take care of us!

257
01:16:53,583 --> 01:16:55,207
Our King...

258
01:16:56,500 --> 01:17:00,999
will surely come back!

259
01:17:57,458 --> 01:17:59,290
Good evening, sweet one.

260
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,749
You are not yet asleep?

261
01:18:16,791 --> 01:18:19,040
And why are you here?

262
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:22,665
Shouldn't you be with your men?

263
01:18:23,333 --> 01:18:24,999
My men should be fine.

264
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:29,665
Men do not smell as nice as women.

265
01:18:30,833 --> 01:18:37,290
And who dares to breach
the impenetrable fortress of Geruda?

266
01:18:39,083 --> 01:18:43,582
So what is the reason
for this late night visit?

267
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:53,332
lfwe don't receive news
from China tomorrow you will be mine.

268
01:18:55,625 --> 01:18:58,290
I have waited long enough.

269
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:04,040
I want to have a peek ofwhat is to be mine.

270
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:08,582
The moon is almost full tonight.

271
01:19:10,333 --> 01:19:14,249
Does it not make you feel
like walking by the shore

272
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:17,790
and enjoying the beauty of the night?

273
01:19:17,958 --> 01:19:21,624
I would rather sit here

274
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:26,790
and drink in your beauty.

275
01:19:28,708 --> 01:19:32,249
Then, I see no harm in that.

276
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:39,540
Let us lie awhile and compose poetry.

277
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:44,582
Poetry?

278
01:20:12,375 --> 01:20:14,124
Can't you stem your impulse?

279
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,665
I have a headache.

280
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:20,874
Come tomorrow night
after I have recovered my vigour.

281
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:22,999
I cannot hold it in much longer.

282
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:24,665
You will be mine tonight.

283
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:28,999
People of Langkasuka.

284
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:35,082
Men of the tribes. Hear me out.

285
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:40,999
For many moons Geruda's talons
have scratched and wounded us,

286
01:27:42,541 --> 01:27:46,915
scarred our hearts
and taken those who are dear to us.

287
01:27:48,291 --> 01:27:52,249
And though I am your King,

288
01:27:53,708 --> 01:27:59,082
but for today I will fight as one of you.

289
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:02,707
The blood that flows within us
is the same colour.

290
01:28:03,166 --> 01:28:04,999
With the same thickness.

291
01:28:05,791 --> 01:28:08,124
We breathe the same air.

292
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,374
Walk on the same ground

293
01:28:12,583 --> 01:28:14,707
covered by the same sky.

294
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:18,457
It is for our children that we do this.

295
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,249
Today...

296
01:28:23,958 --> 01:28:26,374
Some of us may not return.

297
01:28:27,833 --> 01:28:34,832
Maybe many, maybe all of us will die.

298
01:28:37,416 --> 01:28:39,915
But what's the point of living

299
01:28:40,083 --> 01:28:44,165
ifwe are not free
from the brutality that is Geruda?

300
01:28:46,208 --> 01:28:53,207
How long do we allow our sons and daughters
be fed to those monsters?

301
01:28:56,083 --> 01:28:57,290
Yes.

302
01:28:57,541 --> 01:29:03,165
We fight to take back
this young Prince's bride.

303
01:29:04,541 --> 01:29:07,040
But that is not all.

304
01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:12,415
We will also take back our honour.

305
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,249
Our dignity, as the people of Langkasuka

306
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:19,915
does not lie within your King.

307
01:29:20,291 --> 01:29:23,040
It lies within our land that we protect.

308
01:29:26,666 --> 01:29:31,915
I would rather die than live as a slave.

309
01:29:32,875 --> 01:29:37,665
A slave to the terror
and violence of those animals!

310
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:43,790
In the name of our pride
and the sovereignty of our kingdom,

311
01:29:44,208 --> 01:29:50,082
Let us reap the field of Gerudans!

312
01:29:55,083 --> 01:29:57,707
Attack!

313
01:39:57,083 --> 01:39:59,332
Have Geruda's wings been clipped?

314
01:40:04,583 --> 01:40:07,249
I will break every single bone in your body.

315
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,582
I am scared to the bone.

316
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:10,040
Rescue the princess!

317
01:41:12,250 --> 01:41:13,332
Kill the pirates!

318
01:42:12,291 --> 01:42:14,165
This is for Embok's scar.

319
01:42:17,333 --> 01:42:20,457
You bastard!

320
01:42:23,041 --> 01:42:29,749
May your scars never stop bleeding,
even after you die.

321
01:42:33,583 --> 01:42:38,874
The pleasure of Embok I still feel now.

322
01:44:03,333 --> 01:44:07,624
Drop your weapons or your leader dies.

323
01:44:45,291 --> 01:44:48,790
When time and moment gather,

324
01:44:51,041 --> 01:44:54,749
two sides will be as one.

325
01:44:56,958 --> 01:45:00,040
When two shadows come together,

326
01:45:03,916 --> 01:45:07,040
life will unfurl and death will be done.
